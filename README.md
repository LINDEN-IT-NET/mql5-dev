DISCLAIMER

Trading the financial markets is high risk of total financial loss. I'm not responsible for any financial loss that anyone suffers. Content is under development and does not serve as financial advice. If you run this code on any trading account you will end up with 100% loss. One need to know when to run which EA on which asset. Trading is an art and you have to study it for years and decades. I just code to increase my insights in market behaviour.  

Once I thought it must be possible to code an EA that performs and generates profit but now a couple of years later I'm off this dream.
Maybe any longterm strategy might work but life is too short to run it or/and I'm too old. Further it will be very expensive with the overnight costs you have to pay, they might cost you all you have ;-) 

Take care, of yourself and your money!
